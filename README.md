# ProjektT462

### Each class will be explained at the start of it, as well as the methods inside the class; what they do and what are they used for.

- Code as tidy as you can. The more readable the better.
- Make detailed comments in English explaining your code.
- For every upload create a new branch, don't merge.
- Declare methods and objects/instanecs should be declared starting with a lowercase letter. Ex.: private void **_berechneFlaeche_**(); Einfuehrung **_einfuehrung_** = new Einfuehrung();
- It's reccomended to declare variables starting with a lowercase letter too. Ex.: int **_nummer_**;
- Use descriptive names for variables, objects, and classes.
